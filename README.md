# Connect Four!

## Getting Started

### Connect Four is an exciting game for two players. In this game, players choose to be Player One or Player Two. Player One uses a red token while Player Two uses an orange token. Players take turns dropping their tokens down into the game board. The game board has seven columns and six rows.A player can click on any part of a column on the board to have their token dropped in that corresponding column. The tokens will drop all the way down a column until it reaches the lowest space that is open. If a space is taken, the token will be placed above that space.  The object of the game is to get four tokens of the same color in a row! Four in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In the event that the board is filled up with and there are not four tokens in a row, the game is a draw!
